# Quiz-Maker

## Instructions
Create a questions.txt file in the same folder as the .py (if you don't, the program will create one for you anyways)

The file should have in it's first line the score someone needs to pass the quiz. (0 to 10)
From the second line it will be the questions. And they should follow the format:
#### Question Here--NumberOfTheRightOne--Option1--Option2--Option3

It can have as many options as you want. Just be sure to separate them with "--"

## Example of a file:

| questions.txt

*1.* 6.3

*2.* 2+2=?--2--Eight(8)--Four(4)--Three(3)--Nine(9)

*3.* 5-2=?--5--1--6--8--9--3
